## ![logo](./favicon.ico)Introduction
An online board called **Path to the Jedi Order** was developed by the **Jar Jar Jarverscripters** team during the weekend of the Star Wars Hackathon in May 2023.  We present a traditional multiplayer board game with 120 tiles, double dice & 2 types of chance cards. Here is our main board & we hope you enjoy playing it as nuch as we did building it!

Your next option is to choose one of 2 buttons to either **Start** the game or view the **Rules** 

![Start and Rules Buttons](./docs/startrulesbuttons.PNG)

The game starts by setting the number of players and then clicking/rolling the dice. If a player lands on a coloured tile they will be given a corresponding card - either a Force Card (good) or a Trap Card (bad) & have to reap the reward or take the punishment. Each player is prompted appropriately throughout the game until there is a winner & yep you have guessed it, the first player to the end is the **winner**.
