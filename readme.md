## Description
An online board game developed by the Jar Jar Jarverscripters team during the weekend of the Star Wars Hackathon in May 2023.  We present a traditional multiplayer board game with 120 tiles.  Good Luck & we hope you enjoy playing it as nuch as we did building it!

### Audience
This game is intended for people of all ages who may or may not have an interest in the Star Wars franchise.

### Instructions
The game starts by setting the number of players and then clicking/rolling the dice. If a player lands on a coloured tile they will be given a corresponding card - either a Force Card (good) or a Trap Card (bad) & have to reap the reward or take the punishment. First player to the end is the winner.
