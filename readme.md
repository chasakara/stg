## ![logo](./favicon.ico)Introduction
An online board called **Path to the Jedi Order** was developed by the **Jar Jar Jarverscripters** team during the weekend of the Star Wars Hackathon in May 2023.  We present a traditional multiplayer board game with 120 tiles, double dice, 2 types of chance cards & some surprise shortcuts along the way. This is our main board (without background) & we hope you enjoy playing it as much as we did building it!

Your next option is to choose one of 2 buttons to either **Start** the game or view the **Rules** 

![Start and Rules Buttons](./docs/startrulesbuttons.PNG)

The game starts by asking the players (max 4) to choose the Star Wars character they will adopt during the game.

Play will continue with each player getting their turn to roll the dice with some surprises along the way depending where they land, for instance if a player lands on a coloured tile they will be given a corresponding card - either a Force Card or a Trap Card & have to reap the reward or take the punishment. Each player is prompted appropriately throughout the game until there is a winner & yep you have guessed it, the first player to the end is the **winner**.
